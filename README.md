# DIY on-camera Dynamic micrcophone with build-in preamp
 

This project is a dynamic microphone utilizing a cloned SM57 capsule. The circuit incorporates a THAT 1510 preamp and is powered by phantom power from the XLR input. It is also compatible with dynamic microphones that require phantom power. If you wish to use it this way, simply cut the solder bridges and connect the appropriate ones. Additionally, Iâ€™ve left two pins available in case you prefer to power the circuit externally (e.g., with a battery). You can adjust the gain using the onboard knob.
